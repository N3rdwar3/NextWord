    <p>
        Hi, I am surprised anyone is actually reading this.
    </p>
    <p>
        My privacy policy is that I will neither collect nor use any personal data of the users of this app.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ads though on the site are certainly going to collect some form of data but that's kinda what ads do everywhere, and not even ads,
        just visiting websites in general or having apps installed on your phone like
        <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2022/nr-c_220601/">Tim Hortons</a> did a few years back.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm sure this is legally satisfactory, <br/>
        c.
